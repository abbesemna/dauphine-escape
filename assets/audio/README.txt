Place your game audio files here (MP3). The game looks for these names (with or without spaces):

MUSIC (one plays at a time):
  music_intro.mp3     - during intro video frames
  home_page_music.mp3  - on home screen
  gameplay_music.mp3  - during play (keeps during jump/collect; volume 0.5)
  victory_music.mp3   - when you win the last level

SOUND EFFECTS:
  button_click.mp3    - any button (play, exit, restart, next level, etc.)
  ai_exam_attack.mp3         - when the AI exam catches the student
  element_collect.mp3 - when collecting lamp/coffee/book/brain
  jump_sound_click.mp3            - when the student jumps

You can use "button click.mp3" (with space) instead of "button_click.mp3" — both work.
